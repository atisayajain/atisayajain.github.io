No idea myself, to be honest!

For someone who has always been motivated by the idea of reading about everything that is there in the universe, I would just call this my safe space.

I don't think I am anywhere a good writer to engage audiences and influence others. I get to communicate with a lot of people but still find it incredibly hard to share anything regarding me. There are a few things which I do care about but we don't talk about them much and that is exactly I hope to make this about.

I don't plan to achieve anything by writing here or anywhere else. There's no real goal of wanting to do this, except maybe trying to answer a few questions, solve a few mysteries, clear the clutter a little, and hopefully become a better reader and a writer. But since I am highly inspired by science and technology, expect more on that side.

I humbly believe knowledge is the one true power and the only one to which I will solemnly swear my allegiance.

Let's get started.
