Hello, there! Hope you are keeping safe during this pandemic.

If you are reading this article for any given reason, there's a high chance you are looking to build a career in Computer Science or any of its allied fields, and that's what we shall explore in this article.

I have essentially divided everything into a series of 3 parts for better understanding of different aspects concerning the topic and where exactly are you in life right now. I hope whatever I discuss here helps people in the age group of 17 to 23 to start careers and maybe switch at a very early stage.

A little disclaimer, this by no means is a foolproof guide to careers. Every human being is different and so are their skills, experiences and life choices. I only hope that this serves as a good starting point and provides you with some clarity in the conversations you are having with yourself.

So, let's get started.

# What exactly is a professional career?
Let's say you like clicking photographs. One of your friends invited you to cover their younger sibling's birthday. You accepted the offer, covered the event, and your friend paid you something for the gig. 

This is an example of professional skill, as you created value in someone else's life by the means of your labour. 

Is it a professional career? Not yet. Do it repeatedly for 8-10 hours a day for at least five days a week and voila! Now you can call yourself a professional photographer!

So, what do you need to build a professional career in any industry?
* Something you are good with; a professional skill.
* A place you can sell this skill to a buyer; a market.
* A trajectory in which you grow in that industry.

This is roughly what we are going to analyse in this part of the series, the options in hand for someone graduating from a Tier 3 engineering institute in India.

# How to choose a career option?

_Time to get back to JEE days!_

To answer this question, you can always revisit your counselling days after JEE and relate to how you chose a stream over something else. It could be because you liked the curriculum in one over others or the opportunities of growth or straight-up better chance of getting a high paying job from the campus.

Now is time you go through similar questions once again but with a little more specialised education.
* What is it that you can do for 8 hours a day, for five days a week without looking over at the clock?
* How capable are you of moving fast and learning as the project progresses?
* How much are you willing to explore new and unrelated fields on the job?
* Do you like stability over long periods, or would you like to take risks for probably higher rewards?
* What matters to you more? Your compensation/remuneration or satisfaction?
* How patient are you with your goals in life?
* Do you like interaction while on the job or do you work alone?
* Do you work better when guided by someone else or when you work alone?
* Do you want to be Steve Jobs/Elon Musk or Warren Buffet?
* Do you have another underlying hobby which you want to pursue as a career in future?
* Do you want to stay close to your parents or family or it isn't exactly a concern?
* Do you have some lifelong dreams you want to fulfil and you want to fund them? Mine is watching an El Clasico at the Camp Nou. :3
_Etc. Etc. Etc._

By no means, is this a complete list of questions and I am afraid anyone might be able to provide you with one. You always have to have these kinds of conversations with yourself and take a leap of faith to get started with something.

# What are the options available?

_You can be anyone, literally._

I know you might act surprised but there are much lesser options that you can't pursue, compared to the ones you still can. You could still become a doctor if you immigrate to a few countries and appear for their medical examinations where biology isn't a compulsory requirement in your bachelors! You can still get into defence or play any sport easily if you are good enough at the national level. You can get into law or economics or journalism, just by appearing for their masters' admission exams. There are hundreds and thousands of stories of people turning tables for themselves only by grit and hard-work and well some amount of luck.

We will only explore the most popular options though or the ones people are most likely to discuss around you.


| Industry | Starting Role | Starting Step | Progresses To | Management Path | Compensation | Autonomy | Remarks |
| -------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------  | --------------- | ------------ | -------- | ------- |
| Academic Research        | Research Scholar, Asst. Professor            | M.Tech/MS/PhD - GATE/GRE | Tenured Professor | Department Chair, Director of Institute/Lab | Medium & Stable | Very High | This option is not for everyone but only those who do really live for science and want to leave their mark. It requires an inexplicable amount of patience and grit to be successful in academic research for all the failures that you might have to deal with; your finding might get cut, your hypotheses and experiments will fail or wouldn't be good enough, you would have to deal with a lot of students and train them as well. Having said that, you will still enjoy the highest form of autonomy and would actually create or choose the problems you want to work with no one to report to pretty much ever. |
| Industrial Research      | Junior Scientist, Research Engineer          | M.Tech/MS from a prominent institute is favourable to start at a good lab. Though starting out directly from college is also possible. | Scientist, Appliest Scientist | Director, CTO | Very High | High | This is for anyone who still wants to pursue science and research but work on problems which will impact the masses in next few years, rather than say even 100 years like in case of academic research. You don't really enjoy that high an autonomy because your work is expected to create direct gains for the organisation you are working for, but you are compensated pretty handsomely for your efforts, both socially and financially. You might want to read about 'Google Fellows' once. |
| Development/Engineering  | Software Engineer, DevOps/Infrastructure Engineer, Security Engineer | Bachelors Degree is enough. You might need some experience in the domain you are working, as well.  | Senior Engineer, Staff Engineer, Principal Engineer, CTO / VP (Tech) | Engineering Manager, Tech Lead, Product Manager, VP (Product) | Very High | High | For anyone who really likes solving problems of scale by creating and improving products and services, and has enough analytical and technical aptitude to support it, this is for you. It is not easy to get into one directly from a tier-3 college as you need to display your ability and credibility in some form other than just your degree. You will usually be heavily compensated with comparatively very good work-life balance. |
| IT Consultancy Services  | Roles offered by most IT firms | Bachelors Degree and basic aptitude skills | Consultant, IT Analyst, Senior Engineer | Business Lead, Tech Lead | - | - | This is probably the easiest to get into as the firms recruiting are looking for talent at similar places. A lot of your progress in this industry depends on your luck at the beginning, how you are assigned a project or a team. You get a relatively good work-life balance with enough time and energy to spend on other things. For compensation and hikes, it's best if you would talk to your seniors about this. If you aren't sure about anything or still want to explore or say prepare for other exams, this can always be your fallback for a few years right after college. |
| Startup/Freelance        | CEO, CTO, Product Lead | Just a lot of obsession, grit, business acumen, luck and the right network. | Whatever you want to call yourself! | You are managing everything from the beginning. | Very High, if it works. Even if it doesn't your network will always support you if you ever try seriously. | Very High | Just like academic research, this path is not for everyone. It requires an inexplicable amount of infinite things from you to fit in and make it work. You learn something and apply every second of your life. You wear multiple hats at once. You get cursed by your relatives and friends for attempting to do something outrageous if you come from a not-so-pro business family. But you still keep doing it, all in the hope of making your vision a reality. You are motivated not by the money but by the satisfaction of making that one sale or taking that decision which might get your company through the next 6 months. It's like creating and nurturing a baby, but the problem is no one other than will be able to see it unless it walks and runs. |

_(I have tried to provide my personal opinion on various career choices and by no means am I trying to undermine any industry. If you still think, my opinion is fair kindly get back to me and I shall rephrase my point.)_

**A few things to mention**
* You can always get into startups and management roles, at any point in your career in any industry, whatsoever. There is no right time to get onto this track. What might work for you will never work for anyone else.
* **PSUs?** There aren't many PSUs in India offering jobs for CS grads at the moment. But if you do want to get into one, go through the available list of jobs and prepare and apply.
* **Govt. Research (ISRO/DRDO etc.)?** Most of these labs advertise their openings and application procedures every year (around ~40). If you do want to get into Space or Defence research in India you can't do it without being affiliated to any of these organisations.
* **UPSC/SSC?** You know the first step for this, don't you? On a serious note, these are not related to CS directly, so I didn't feel like including them. But if you are passionate about being one, sure, go for it!
* **Higher Studies?** Will explore in the next part.

I hope this helps you in clearing your queries regarding all that is possible while staying in Computer Science and makes you create a better and informed decision. Let's call this part, **Planning**.

Hopefully, you read the next parts in the series as well on **Preparing** and **Achieving**.
